**Objective**
The objective of this project is to develop a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system to manage and secure user access rights within an application. By implementing this project, users and administrators can control access to resources, ensuring that permissions are assigned based on roles rather than individuals, thereby improving security and scalability.

**Steps Involved**
**npm init -y
npm install express mongoose bcrypt jsonwebtoken dotenv cors body-parser
npm install --save-dev nodemon**

1. Project Setup
Initialize the project with Express.js for backend development.
Install necessary dependencies using npm or yarn.


2. Environment Configuration
Create a .env file to store sensitive information like database connection strings and secret keys.
Add environment variables such as MONGO_URI for MongoDB connection.

3. Database Setup
Use MongoDB to store user details, roles, and permissions.
Define models for users, roles, and permissions in the models directory.

**past your url in .env file
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret**

5. Routes and Controllers
Set up authentication and authorization routes in the routes directory.
Implement the logic for user registration, login, and assigning roles in the controllers.

6. Middleware Implementation
Develop middleware for verifying tokens and checking role-based permissions.
Integrate these middleware functions to secure specific routes.

7. Testing with Postman
Use Postman to test the API endpoints such as:
User registration and login.
Assigning roles and permissions.
Securing routes and verifying access.

**Applications**
Enterprise Applications: Control employee access to internal systems and data based on their roles (e.g., HR, admin, finance).

Education Portals: Manage access for students, teachers, and administrators with distinct permissions.

E-Commerce Platforms: Restrict administrative operations like inventory management to authorized roles.

Healthcare Systems: Protect patient data by granting access only to medical staff and authorized personnel.

Cloud Services: Secure API endpoints by enforcing role-based restrictions for developers, admins, and users.
